# DoneWithIt

A react native application to sell stuff that you don't need anymore  
I'm doing this app to challenge myself and improve my skills about react native

I'm using a backend in nodejs located in server folder.

Note: This server hasn't been wroted by me.

To start the application:

```
yarn start
```

This command will start server as well.
